The visualization provides insights into Netflix's viewing habits, including the most popular shows and genres, as well as the demographics of Netflix's audience. The data is sourced from publicly available sources and cleaned using Python. The Tableau workbook includes several interactive dashboards that allow users to explore the data in different ways. The visualizations are designed to be easy to understand and provide valuable insights for anyone interested in the streaming platform. The project is a great example of how data visualization can be used to gain insights from complex data.
